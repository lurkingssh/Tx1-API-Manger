This Only Works On Ubuntu 20.04 +
If You Want It To Work On Another "OS" You Need To Open "autosetup.py"
& Change All The Commands To You're "OS's" Commands!

Keep In Mind If You Don't Want To Use Auto Setup I Added A Manual Setup
For You Skeeds <3.

For Auto Setup Just Run:

"Python3 AutoSetup.py"
